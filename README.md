# Blockchain-Development-Studies

I'm a software developer with a CS degree and 3 years of professional experience who decided to leave my job in order to self-educate myself on Smart Contract Development. Because of the lack of traditional educational programs in this emerging field, a large part of my studies will be focused on the "Blockchain Development Guide" laid out here:
https://haseebq.com/the-authoritative-guide-to-blockchain-development/

It does a good job of covering plenty of subjects that aren’t required for Smart Contract Development, but are definitely prerequisites for being able to understand what’s going on “under the hood.” These are the subjects covered:
Computer Science: Data Structures, Cryptography, Distributed Systems, Networking.
Economics: Game Theory, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics
Blockchain Theory: Bitcoin Fundamentals, Building a Blockchain, Ethereum Fundamentals

After going over these subjects thoroughly, the guide provides resources for smart contract development and security.


I am posting all code I write throughout this process here.
